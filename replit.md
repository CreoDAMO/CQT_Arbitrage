# CryptoQuest Arbitrage Bot

## Overview

The CryptoQuest Arbitrage Bot is a sophisticated cross-chain arbitrage trading system designed to capitalize on price differences of CQT tokens between Polygon and Base networks. The system combines machine learning predictions, zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-resistant cryptography, and ERC-4337 account abstraction to execute profitable arbitrage trades automatically.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Layer Architecture
- **Frontend Layer**: Web-based dashboard with real-time monitoring and control interface
- **Application Layer**: Python-based core logic with ML predictions and trading algorithms
- **Blockchain Layer**: Smart contracts deployed on Polygon and Base networks
- **Integration Layer**: External service integrations (Coinbase CDP, Uniswap, AggLayer)

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ with asyncio for concurrent operations
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.20 with OpenZeppelin libraries
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Chart.js for visualizations

- **Responsive design**: Bootstrap-based UI with Chart.js visualizations

## Data Flow

### Arbitrage Detection Flow
1. **Price Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of CQT prices on both networks
2. **ML Analysis**: LSTM model predicts optimal execution timing
3. **Opportunity Identification**: Calculate potential profit after gas costs
4. **ZK Verification**: Generate privacy-preserving proofs for transactions
5. **Cross-Chain Execution**: Execute trades using AggLayer bridge
6. **Profit Realization**: Complete arbitrage cycle and distribute profits

### Data Sources
- **On-chain**: Uniswap V3 pools, token balances, gas prices
- **Off-chain**: External price feeds, market data, ML predictions
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
